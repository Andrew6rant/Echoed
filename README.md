# Echoed

Minecraft mod that expands upon Echo Shards and other 1.19 content.

Currently adds an Echo Glass block and an Echo Key item, expands the Swift Sneak enchantment to go up to level 4, and a petrified Allay statue (does nothing for now).

Echo Glass is a block that can only be interacted with if the user is holding a block of Echo Glass (or an Echo Key). Holding an Echo Key will remove the collision hitbox of the Glass.

Petrified Allay is a statue that is found randomly in the Deep Dark. Splash it with a potion of regeneration and feed an Enchanted Golden Cookie to it to turn it into an Allay mob. (not yet implemented)
